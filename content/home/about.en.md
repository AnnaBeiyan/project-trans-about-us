Project Trans has been converted from the MtF wiki team to better maintain several projects such as MtF wiki, FtM wiki and others.

Project Trans strives to create a free, open and continuously updated platform for transgender knowledge and information. We believe that everyone has an equal right to choose their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, free from stigma, discrimination and violence.

We welcome more people to [join us](https://github.com/project-trans) and contribute to the transgender community.
